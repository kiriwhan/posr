This website is to be considered as a guide only. It has been created to help Landcarers, gardeners and south-coast region plant enthusiasts in the field.

The website is a lite version of the Plants of the Shoalhaven Region database. The full database was developed by Carolyn and Malcolm Whan of presOz Computer Services. Development of the database was motivated by a lack of easily accessible and clear information for plant identification in the south-coast region. The database combines 15-years of botanical research, art, photography and computing. 

The full POSR database contains many more search features and additional information about many plant species. To purchase or access this database contact: posr@presoz.com.au

Carolyn (Masters of Curriculum Studies) had over 30 years experience creating and teaching art. Together, Carolyn and Malcolm have been involved with environmental education since 1991 when they completed the educational series 'DuneCare'. They started Milton Rural Landcare Inc. in 1998.
